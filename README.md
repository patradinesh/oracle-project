# oracle-project
This is a basic project for an Oracle Interview. Documentation follows

### OCI Sign up:
1. Sign up for a free tier OCI account: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/
2. Once it takes your credit card information ( even though it is a free account), you get a notification that it takes 15 mins to create an account.

*NOTE: Though it says 15 mins, I did not get the email for 3 hours, so I reached out to support and they mentioned, it might take 4-8 hours to get an activation email.*
